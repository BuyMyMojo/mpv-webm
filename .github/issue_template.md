If possible/applicable, attach a sample file (especially if the problem seems specific to that file).

## Log file

Attach the log file here. To generate a log file, you can add `log-file=log.txt` temporarily to your mpv.conf (it will be placed on the same location of the video file). You can use services like [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) or similar ones to upload the file.
